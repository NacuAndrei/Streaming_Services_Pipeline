# Streaming_Services_Data

This is a project that I have worked on with 5 other interns during my internship programme at Tremend. The project is about cleaning and scraping data for streaming services: Spotify, Youtube, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Netflix. The data was subsequently provided to data analysts to extract insights.
